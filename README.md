# FinalYearProject

The project I’m undertaking for my Final Year Project is related to the list colouring problem and its applications in scheduling problems.
The title for my project is ‘The List Colouring Problem and Scheduling’.
This program takes a Constraint Programming approach to the FYP Scheduling Problem using the MiniZinc language.
