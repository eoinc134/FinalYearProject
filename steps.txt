L  = CAL ?
Ls = list of available time periods for lecturers

Algorithm:

    main():
    1) Initialize L with Ls
    2) Find clique C alap
    3) for each feasible colouring of C:
        color()

    color():
        1) if (leaf reached ¦¦ cut-off criterion) return
        2) Pick next vertex v
        3) for each color c in L[v] 
            - assign c to v and color()
            - uncolor v and update
